# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews using Neural Networks

This project implements and compares three different machine learning models for sentiment analysis on the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset. The models include Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.

## 📋 Overview

The project performs binary sentiment classification (positive/negative) on movie reviews using three different approaches:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A traditional machine learning approach using bag-of-words representation
2. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: A simple neural network with embedding and dense layers
3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A recurrent neural network that captures sequential patterns in text

## 🎯 Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of three different models
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Model checkpointing to save best weights
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Visualization of results including:
  - Word cloud of training data
  - Confusion matrices
  - Training history plots
  - Model comparison bar chart

## 📈 Output

The script generates several visualization files:
- `wordcloud.png`: Word cloud of the training data
- `lr_confusion_matrix.png`: Confusion matrix for Logistic Regression
- `ann_confusion_matrix.png`: Confusion matrix for ANN
- `ann_training_history.png`: Training history for ANN
- `lstm_confusion_matrix.png`: Confusion matrix for LSTM
- `lstm_training_history.png`: Training history for LSTM
- `model_comparison.png`: Bar chart comparing accuracy scores

The best models are saved in the `models` directory:
- `models/ann_best_model.h5`: Best ANN model weights
- `models/lstm_best_model.h5`: Best LSTM model weights
