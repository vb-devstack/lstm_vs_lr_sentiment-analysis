# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews using Neural Networks

This project implements and compares three different machine learning models for sentiment analysis on the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset. The models include Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.

## üìã Overview

The project performs binary sentiment classification (positive/negative) on movie reviews using three different approaches:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A traditional machine learning approach using bag-of-words representation
2. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: A simple neural network with embedding and dense layers
3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A recurrent neural network that captures sequential patterns in text

## üéØ Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of three different models
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Model checkpointing to save best weights
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics

  - Confusion matrices
  - Training history plots
  - Model comparison bar chart

## üìà Output

The script generates several visualization files:
- `wordcloud.png`: Word cloud of the training data
- `lr_confusion_matrix.png`: Confusion matrix for Logistic Regression
- `ann_confusion_matrix.png`: Confusion matrix for ANN
- `ann_training_history.png`: Training history for ANN
- `lstm_confusion_matrix.png`: Confusion matrix for LSTM
- `lstm_training_history.png`: Training history for LSTM
- `model_comparison.png`: Bar chart comparing accuracy scores

## üìä Data Analysis

The project includes a comprehensive data analysis script (`data_analysis.py`) that provides insights into the IMDB dataset before model training. The analysis includes:

### Visualizations
- **Sequence Length Analysis**: Distribution of review lengths in training and testing sets
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Top 20 most frequent words in the dataset
- **Class Distribution**: Distribution of positive and negative reviews
- **Word Cloud**: Visual representation of common words in reviews
- **Sentiment Length Distribution**: Review length distribution by sentiment

### Statistics
- Average and median review lengths
- Word frequency statistics
- Class distribution percentages
- Review length statistics by sentiment

To run the analysis:
```bash
python data_analysis.py
```

This will generate the following visualization files:
- `sequence_length_analysis.png`: Histogram and box plot of review lengths
- `word_frequency.png`: Bar chart of most frequent words
- `class_distribution.png`: Pie charts of class distribution
- `wordcloud.png`: Word cloud of common words
- `sentiment_length_distribution.png`: Violin plot of review lengths by sentiment
